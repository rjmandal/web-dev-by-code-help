                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <article>Linus Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer who is the creator and principal
                    developer of the
                    Linux kernel, which is the kernel for a number of operating systems. He also created the version
                    control
                    system Git. Torvalds was born on December 28, 1969 in Helsinki, Finland. He studied computer science
                    at
                    the
                    University of Helsinki, and he developed the Linux kernel as a student project in 1991. Since then,
                    the
                    Linux kernel has become one of the most widely used kernels in the world, powering everything from
                    smartphones to supercomputers.</article>
